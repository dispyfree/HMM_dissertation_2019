- there appear to be two kinds of foward-backwards probabilities! Which one to use?


todo: implement FB (stochastic) sampling!


- does it make sense to go for sequence alignment?


TODO: photocopy \chi^2 derivation in Montgomery for Eric!

thesis: 
- include graphics from ZUcchini?!
- prevent label switching by reordering states if constraint not fulfilled any more 


expectation:
MH: chains are more sticky
Gibbs: mixes quicker, less iterations, but each iteration more costly
=> measure time as well


=> produce quantitative versions (under which conditions, different # states, length of chains ...)
# of iterations, # of computations


=> use other, quantitative criteria for convergence diagnostics
effective sample size metric/ESS/riemann sum as metric! (coda in R as package)
